>We are stuck with technology when what we really want is just stuff that works.  
<cite>Douglas Adams</cite>

I recently had an interesting discussion in [our club][ITCLC] about technology minimalist mindset in our industry of IT "solutions". We, IT Craftsmen, are fascinated by technology. Yet to become skillful and *artistic* in solving problems by means of information technology we have to treat it as a compromise. We have to know it comes with a cost. A sobering and mature view of deployed technology is as just a smaller problem compared to the one it is "solving".

*The technology we deliver is not a solution, it is a compromise.*

Since every technology comes with a cost, one way to become more effective problem solvers is to make sure that technology we deploy is the minimum that does the job. This frugality applies at every level. It means that every line of code, every level of indirection, every framework or remote call should be applied only if unavoidable in your circumstances.
